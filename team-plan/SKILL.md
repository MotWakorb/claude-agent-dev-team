# Team Planning Session

This skill orchestrates a parallel planning session across all six personas. Each persona analyzes the project brief independently, then the team comes together to debate, disagree, and produce a unified plan with decision points for the PO.

## Process

### Step 0: Get the Brief

If the PO hasn't provided a project brief yet, ask for one. The brief should include:
- **What user/customer problem are we solving?** Not what we're building — what problem exists for real people
- **Who specifically is affected?** Name the user type, customer segment, or stakeholder
- **What does success look like for them?** How will their experience change? What metric or signal proves we solved it?
- **What evidence do we have that this problem matters?** Support tickets, user research, revenue data, churn analysis, compliance requirement with a deadline — not "we think users would like this"
- Any known constraints (timeline, budget, team size, existing systems)?
- Any known technical requirements or preferences?

If the PO has already provided this context in the conversation, proceed directly. If the brief describes a solution without stating the user problem, push back: "What user problem does this solve?"

### Step 1: Determine Depth

Ask the PO or infer from context:

**Quick mode** — lightweight analysis, bullet points, 15-minute team meeting:
- Each agent produces a focused summary (key concerns, risks, recommendations)
- Debate focuses on the top 2-3 conflicts
- Output is a concise plan with decision points

**Full mode** — complete structured output per each persona's format:
- Each agent produces their full domain analysis (architecture proposal, threat model, work plan, UX research, implementation plan, quality standards)
- Debate covers all identified conflicts
- Output is a comprehensive plan document

Default to **quick** unless the PO specifies full or the project scope clearly warrants it.

### Step 2: Spawn Parallel Agents

Launch all 10 persona agents simultaneously using the Agent tool. **IMPORTANT: All agents must be spawned as `general-purpose` type** (subagent_type: "general-purpose"). The persona identity comes from the prompt, not the agent type. Each agent must:
1. Read their persona skill file for full context
2. Read the shared engineering discipline and conflict resolution protocol
3. Analyze the project brief from their domain perspective
4. Produce their domain-specific output
5. Explicitly note where they anticipate disagreement with other personas

**Each agent prompt must include:**
- The full project brief from the PO
- The depth mode (quick or full)
- An instruction to advocate for their domain — not to silently average or be accommodating
- An instruction to flag anticipated conflicts with specific other personas

#### Security Engineer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/security-engineer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the Security Engineer. Analyze the following project brief from a security perspective. Produce your analysis per your skill's methodology and output format.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Security risks that could harm users (data exposure, account compromise, service disruption) — prioritize by user impact, not CVSS score alone
- Compliance requirements with real deadlines or user-facing consequences
- Security constraints that shape the architecture — but justify each by the user harm it prevents
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the architect, engineer, or UX designer — state your position clearly

Frame every security recommendation in terms of user impact: "Users' payment data could be exposed" not just "This fails PCI DSS requirement 3.4." Advocate for security that protects users. Do not generate findings that create work without proportional user benefit.
```

#### IT Architect Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/it-architect/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the IT Architect. Analyze the following project brief and produce an architecture proposal per your skill's methodology and output format.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Phase 1 architecture that delivers the user value described in the brief — no more, no less
- Phase 2 only if the brief includes evidence of growth (signed contracts, usage projections, capacity data) — not speculative "what if we need 100x"
- Technology decisions justified by user needs and operational cost, not technical preference
- Cost model tied to user value — what does each architectural choice cost per user served?
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with security (on control complexity), the engineer (on implementation complexity), or UX (on infrastructure requirements) — state your position clearly

Advocate for architecture that serves the user problem. Challenge yourself: "Would I still propose this architecture if we had half the budget and twice the urgency?" Do not design for hypothetical scale.
```

#### Project Manager Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/project-manager/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the Project Manager / Scrum Master. Analyze the following project brief and produce a project plan per your skill's methodology and output format.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Work breakdown structure — epics and key tasks, each with a user value statement
- Work plan skeleton — what delivers user value first? Sequence by user impact, not technical convenience
- Risk register — what could prevent users from getting value? (Not just project risks — user outcome risks)
- Dependencies between workstreams — which are truly blocking and which are domain preferences?
- What the PO needs to decide before work can begin
- Where you anticipate tension between personas generating work vs. delivering user value — state the trade-offs clearly

Advocate for delivering user value. Challenge any work that can't articulate who benefits and how. Every persona will find more work in their domain — your job is to ask "does the user need this?"
```

#### Project Engineer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/project-engineer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the Project Engineer. Analyze the following project brief and produce an implementation assessment per your skill's methodology and output format.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Implementation feasibility — can we build what delivers the user value within the stated constraints?
- What's the fastest path to getting the core user value into users' hands? What can wait?
- TDD strategy focused on user-facing behavior, not internal implementation details
- Technical risks that could prevent users from getting value
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the architect (on complexity), security (on implementation burden), or UX (on feasibility) — state your position clearly

Advocate for the simplest implementation that delivers the user value. Challenge work that makes the engineering elegant but doesn't change the user outcome.
```

#### UX Designer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/ux-designer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the UX Designer. Analyze the following project brief and produce a UX assessment per your skill's methodology and output format.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- User types affected by the problem described in the brief — who are they and what do they experience today?
- Key user stories that directly address the stated problem — not aspirational features
- The smallest design that solves the user's problem — what's the simplest flow that delivers the value?
- Accessibility as a baseline, not an add-on
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with security (on user friction), the architect (on infrastructure constraints), or the engineer (on feasibility) — state your position clearly

Advocate for solving the user's actual problem. Challenge yourself: "Am I designing the ideal experience, or the experience that solves the stated problem?" Don't expand scope beyond the user need.
```

#### Code Reviewer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the Code Reviewer. Analyze the following project brief and produce quality standards and conventions for this project per your skill's methodology.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- API contract conventions that serve API consumers (the users of the API) — not internal aesthetics
- Quality standards proportional to user impact — critical paths get more rigor, internal utilities get less
- Test strategy focused on user-facing behavior and the user value being delivered
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the engineer (on velocity vs. quality), the architect (on API design), or the PM (on timeline pressure) — state your position clearly

Advocate for quality that serves users. Challenge yourself: "Does this quality standard improve the user's experience, or does it improve how I feel about the code?"
```

#### Database Engineer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/database-engineer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the Database Engineer. Analyze the following project brief and produce a data architecture assessment per your skill's methodology.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Data model that supports the user-facing features described in the brief — design for the access patterns users create, not theoretical ones
- Database engine selection justified by the actual workload, not preference
- Migration strategy that doesn't disrupt users during delivery
- Performance considerations tied to user-facing latency and SLOs — "this query could be faster" is only relevant if users notice
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the architect (on data architecture), the engineer (on ORM usage), or the UX designer (on API response shapes that require expensive queries) — state your position clearly

Advocate for data integrity that serves users. Challenge yourself: "Is this schema decision driven by the user's data needs, or by my preference for normalization purity?"
```

#### SRE Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/sre/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the SRE. Analyze the following project brief and produce an operational readiness plan per your skill's methodology.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- SLOs derived from user expectations — what latency, availability, and correctness do users actually need? Don't gold-plate SLOs beyond user expectations
- Observability that helps you detect when users are affected — not observability for its own sake
- Alerting tied to user impact — alert on user-facing symptoms, not internal metrics that don't correlate to user experience
- Deployment safety that protects users from bad releases (health checks, rollback, canary)
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the architect (on operational complexity), the engineer (on deployment practices), or the PM (on reliability work vs. feature work) — state your position clearly

Advocate for reliability that users experience. Challenge yourself: "If I didn't build this observability, would users notice? Would we fail to detect a user-facing problem?"
```

#### QA Engineer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/qa-engineer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the QA Engineer. Analyze the following project brief and produce a test strategy per your skill's methodology.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Test strategy focused on user-facing behavior and the user value being delivered — test what users experience, not internal implementation details
- Risk-based testing priorities — what's most likely to break the user's experience?
- Performance testing tied to user SLOs — not abstract benchmarks
- Test investment proportional to user impact — critical user paths get thorough testing, internal utilities get basic coverage
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the engineer (on test coverage), the PM (on test time), or the code reviewer (on test standards) — state your position clearly

Advocate for testing that catches user-facing problems. Challenge yourself: "Does this test protect users, or does it protect my coverage metric?"
```

#### Technical Writer Agent
```
Read ~/.claude/skills/technical-writer/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/_shared/engineering-discipline.md, and ~/.claude/skills/_shared/conflict-resolution.md.

You are the Technical Writer. Analyze the following project brief and produce a documentation plan per your skill's methodology.

Depth: [quick|full]

Project Brief:
[brief]

Specifically address:
- Documentation that serves users: API docs consumers actually reference, user guides that reduce support tickets, runbooks that reduce outage duration
- Documentation proportional to user impact — critical user-facing APIs get thorough docs, internal utilities get inline comments
- What documentation would actually reduce user friction or support burden?
- Where you anticipate disagreeing with the engineer (on documentation effort), the PM (on documentation time), or anyone who says "we'll document it later" — state your position clearly

Advocate for documentation that helps someone. Challenge yourself: "Will anyone read this, or am I documenting for completeness?" Write for the person who needs it, not for the audit.
```

### Step 3: Facilitate the Team Debate

After all agents report back, DO NOT simply concatenate their outputs. Synthesize.

**3a. Identify Conflicts**

Read all outputs and identify every point where two or more personas disagree. Categorize each conflict — and critically, frame every conflict in terms of user impact, not domain preference:

| Conflict | Personas | User Impact | Stakes |
|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| [Description] | Security vs. Architect | [How does each option affect users?] | [What happens to users if we go each way] |
| [Description] | Engineer vs. UX | [How does each option affect users?] | [What happens to users if we go each way] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Also identify a second category: **Work Creation Conflicts** — where a persona is proposing work that another persona (or the PM) believes doesn't deliver proportional user value. These are the most important conflicts to surface.

**3b. Present Each Conflict**

For each conflict, present BOTH sides faithfully — do not average, do not pick a winner:

```markdown
### Conflict: [Title]

**[Persona A] says:**
[Their position, in their voice, with their reasoning]

**[Persona B] says:**
[Their position, in their voice, with their reasoning]

**User impact:**
[What happens to users/customers with each choice — not what happens to the architecture, the codebase, or the team]

**Conflict Resolution Protocol says:**
[Which persona has domain authority here, and what the escalation path is]
```

**3c. Identify Agreements**

Also surface where all personas align — genuine alignment is signal too. But verify it's real alignment, not silent averaging. If everyone agrees, ask: is this because it's obviously correct, or because nobody pushed hard enough?

### Step 4: Decision Points for the PO

Present a clear list of decisions the PO needs to make:

```markdown
## Decision Points

### Decision 1: [Title]
- **User impact**: [How does this decision affect users/customers?]
- **Context**: [Why this decision matters]
- **Option A**: [Description] — advocated by [personas]. User outcome: [what users get]
- **Option B**: [Description] — advocated by [personas]. User outcome: [what users get]
- **Trade-off**: [What users gain/lose with each — not what the team gains/loses]
- **Recommendation**: [If the team has a majority view, state it. If split, say so]

### Decision 2: [Title]
...
```

Do NOT make these decisions. Present the trade-offs and let the PO decide. After the PO decides, document it.

### Step 5: Produce the Unified Plan

After the PO has made their decisions, produce a single unified plan document that incorporates all decisions:

```markdown
# Project Plan: [Project Name]

## Date: [Date]
## Participants: Security Engineer, IT Architect, Project Manager, Project Engineer, UX Designer, Code Reviewer

## User Problem
[The user/customer problem this project solves — from the brief]

## Success Criteria
[How we'll know users benefited — measurable outcomes]

## Project Brief
[Original brief]

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Choice | User Impact | Rationale | Dissent |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------|---------|
| ... | ... | [What users get] | PO's reasoning | [Who disagreed and why — for the record] |

## Architecture
[From architect, adjusted per decisions]

## Security Requirements
[From security engineer, adjusted per decisions]

## UX Approach
[From UX designer, adjusted per decisions]

## Implementation Plan
[From engineer, adjusted per decisions]

## Quality Standards
[From code reviewer]

## Project Plan
[From PM — WBS, work plan, risk register, adjusted per decisions]

## Open Items
[Anything not yet resolved — becomes beads]
```

### Step 6: Create Beads

If a beads database is initialized, create the initial epic and task structure from the unified plan using `bd` commands. If no database exists, present the `bd create` commands the PO can run.
